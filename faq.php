              <p id="paccord">~ Why is it Mario & Asia Italian Restaurant? Here's the answer ~</p>
              <p id="paccord">
                The name "Mario" and "Asia" are father and daughter. MARIO is the Italian owner and ASIA is her daughter. 
                We prefer to put that name so we can come up for a unique name of our restaurant.

            <div class="accordion__content">
              <p id="paccord">~ 2019, the year that we started it all ~</p>
              <p id="paccord">
                We established Mario & Asia Italian Restaurant since December of 2019 from home. Then we brought into 
                the market on September 2020 and at its present. We will work hard to make our food business reach its 
                potential to be one of the reliable and biggest growing restaurant in the Philippines.
